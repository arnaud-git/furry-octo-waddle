*******************************
*****    Bugs Noticed     *****
*******************************
- In Learn when you suppress the word in the first fragment, the app crashes.
- [FIXED] The fragments are not updated after a modification, we need to come back to the home menu.
- The last fragment does not validate the answer in the activity 'Test'.





*******************************
***** Future Improvements *****
*******************************
- In the activity test, propose either the word or its translation.
- In the activity test, give the choice to the user between word/translation/both.
- In the activity test, let the user skip or obtain a hint.
- Change TextView search in Translate_layout into a SearchView (implies knowledge of Cursor)
- Add some features in the activity 'Test': success rate, timer, etc.
